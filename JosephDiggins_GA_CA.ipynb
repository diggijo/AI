GAs emulate the process of natural selection and evolution to search for the best possible solution. In the context of Sudoku, a potential solution can be represented as a chromosome, consisting of 9 genes, where each gene represents a row in the grid. The algorithm evolves a population of candidate solutions through processes like crossover and mutation, gradually improving the fitness of the individuals until an optimal or near-optimal solution is found. Given the discrete and combinatorial nature of Sudoku, where valid solutions need to satisfy a set of constraints, Genetic Algorithms provide an effective approach for exploring the solution space and finding satisfactory solutions.\n",

        "The complexity of a Sudoku problem lies in its combinatorial nature, where a seemingly simple 9x9 grid conceals intricate patterns and interdependencies. While Sudoku puzzles typically start with a partially filled grid, the challenge emerges from the need to complete the puzzle by adhering to strict rules: each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1 through 9 without repetition. The constraint satisfaction problem inherent in Sudoku makes it NP-complete, meaning there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve all instances efficiently. As one progresses in solving a Sudoku puzzle, the interlocking constraints introduce a cascading effect, where filling one cell influences multiple others. The logical deductions required for successful solving often demand a combination of pattern recognition, elimination strategies, and occasionally trial-and-error, adding to the puzzle's complexity. Sudoku's appeal lies in its ability to engage both novice and expert puzzle solvers, with varying degrees of difficulty stemming from the intricate interplay of constraints within the grid.\n",

        "The population size determines the number of potential solutions in each generation, influencing the diversity of the population and the algorithm's ability to explore different solution spaces. A larger population often allows for a more thorough exploration but comes with increased computational costs. The child rate per generation dictates how many offspring are generated from each pair of parents, impacting the balance between exploration and exploitation of promising solutions. A higher child rate can lead to a more rapid convergence, but it might also increase the risk of premature convergence to suboptimal solutions. The rate of gene mutation introduces randomness, allowing the algorithm to explore new possibilities and escape local optima. Lastly, the number of iterations represents the maximum number of generations the algorithm will run, acting as a termination criterion to prevent indefinite execution.\n",

        "The results revealed a notable limitation in solving puzzles beyond the easy level. Despite its success in finding a solution for easy and medium-level puzzles, the algorithm faced increasing difficulty and inefficiency when confronted with harder puzzles. The algorithm encountered problems for puzzles categorised as hard, expert, master and blank. The algorithm failed to converge to a solution within a reasonable time frame. The GA seems to get stuck on a certain cost for a prolonged period of time without improvement. This outcome underscores the inherent complexity of Sudoku puzzles beyond the easy difficulty level. It is important to acknowledge that without limitations on the algorithm's iterations, there exists the potential for solving more challenging puzzles, albeit at the cost of significantly increased computation time. However, it is essential to highlight that the algorithm's performance in solving harder puzzles is currently hampered by its relatively slow solution, indicating the need for further optimisation or alternative strategies to enhance its efficacy in tackling more intricate Sudoku configurations.\n",
